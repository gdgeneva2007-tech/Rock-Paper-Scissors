# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Add UI and event triggers

1.In JavaScript,most of web development is driven by events,not loops.Loops failed in this program for the timeline reason.
2.In this project,use the 'click' events to trigger 'playRound', and use a function to check the winner.remove the loop entirely.
